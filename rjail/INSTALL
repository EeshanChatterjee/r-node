Documentation for jailing R:

Install jailkit from:

    http://olivier.sessink.nl/jailkit/jk_init.8.html

Create the jail:

    sudo mkdir /jail-r/
    sudo jk_init  -v -c jailkit.ini  -j /jail-r/ R  
    sudo useradd rstat
    gcc -r chwrap chwrap.c

Copy in Rserve.sh to /jail-r/bin/

    cp Rserve.sh /jail-r/bin/

Ensure the Rserve configuration is as you want, and if you have 
a password file ensure that you've copied that over.

Then run the jail:

sudo /home/jlove/dev/jail-r/chwrap <id of rstat> <id of rstat group> /jail-r/ /bin/Rserve.sh

Note that the ID's must be used, otherwise it won't work - Rserve will run as 
the root user.

Check that the Rserve process is running, as the right user:

ps -ef | grep Rserve

The base jail directory needs to be root owned the whole tree up.


You'll need to run the R-Node server as the rstat user as well, to ensure that
temporary files created by R can be read by R-Node.

Introduction
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

R-Node is a web front-end to the statistical analysis package R. 

Using this front-end, you can from any web browser connect to an R instance
running on a remote (or local) server, and interact with it, sending commands
and receiving the responses.

In particular, graphing commands such as plot() and hist() will execute in
the browser, drawing the graph as an SVG image.

Software Utilised
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

This software would not be where it is today without a number of key 
technology projects that it uses. These are, in no particular order:

  * ExtJS Core

    ExtJS Core provides a decent object inheritance mechanism for 
    Javascript code.

  * JQuery

    JQuery provides a decent DOM access and manipulation system for the
    client UI.
    
  * JQuery Fancybox

    Used for showing graphs in the client application.
    
  * Node.JS - http://nodejs.org/

    An events based I/O library and execution environment for V8 Javascript
    (http://code.google.com/p/v8/, the Google Chrome javascript engine).
    This provides an exceedingly easy environment to develop the server
    componentry in for R-Node.

  * Protovis - http://vis.stanford.edu/protovis/

    Protovis provides an excellent graphing API, allowing the graphical 
    commands of R to be effectively implemented in the browser.

  * Rserve - http://www.rforge.net/Rserve/doc.html

    This is a binary server that allows communication over tcp/ip with a
    running R instance. It is used by the R-Node server componentry to
    communicate with R.

  * R - http://www.r-project.org/ 

Each of these projects has their own licensing, as mentioned below. The
R-Node code itself is covered by a number of licenses due to the use of
these projects as libraries and in some cases as code embedded within
R-Node.

Licenses
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

  * ExtJS Core

    ExtJS Core is licensed under the MIT license, as mentioned here:
    http://www.extjs.com/products/core/download.php

  * JQuery

    JQuery is included in this project under the MIT license, as described
    here: http://jquery.org/license.

  * JQuery Fancybox

    JQuery Fancybox is included in this project under the MIT license, as 
    described in the code provided in 3rdparty/jquery/fancybox

  * Node.JS

    BSD license. R-Node uses the Node.JS software to execute its server
    side component, but does not alter the source at all. All Node.JS
    source can be retreived from http://nodejs.org/.

  * Protovis

    BSD license. R-Node uses protovis but (currently) does not alter the 
    source code. The standard minified protovis library is included
    for installation simplicity. All source can be retrieved from
    http://gitorious.com/protovis.

  * Rserve

    R-Node connects to Rserve over TCP/IP, and assumes that Rserver is
    installed and running already on the system. Some Rserve example
    code has been used in creating the server library for connecting 
    to Rserve (see server/src/include), and this is 

    This code is distributed originally under the GNU LGPL, and continues
    to be so here.

  * R-Node

    R-Node itself is covered by the license as described in the LICENSE
    file.

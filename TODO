# Quick TODO list, until I get a issue tracker running for R-Node
#

Configuration of file upload has it's own 'R tmp'/'our tmp' directory
configuration. This needs to use the generic one.


The code in the R handler to download files to the client needs to be
moved into the main codebase to support generic file download, linked
to session.


The client needs to allow the choice between:
  client graph generation with server fallback
  always use server graph generation.


The server side graphs generated need to support interactive creation
of graphs over multiple commands.


Such graphs also should be shown like client drawn graphs - though 
downloaded differently.


The client UI should have an interface to save and load sessions, saved
to a per-username. Only available when users must log in.


Need to implement caching on the server, to stop the delivery of all
the files all the time. Also should have a switch to allow the system
to direct users at google code apis for ExtJS.

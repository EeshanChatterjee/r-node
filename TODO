# Quick TODO list, until I get a issue tracker running for R-Node

Configuration of file upload has it's own 'R tmp'/'our tmp' directory
configuration. This needs to use the generic one.


The code in the R handler to download files to the client needs to be
moved into the main codebase to support generic file download, linked
to session.


The client UI should have an interface to save and load sessions, saved
to a per-username. Only available when users must log in.


Need to implement caching on the server, to stop the delivery of all
the files all the time. Also should have a switch to allow the system
to direct users at google code apis for ExtJS.


It seems that R version 2.10 includes a new help mechanism, which breaks
R-Node's current approach to retrieving the HTML help.

Multiline commands in the console.

Functions to support:

1/  help()  under R 2.10
2/  ?? searching help
3/  sink() doesn't work 
4/ Complex numbers don't get past the parser
5/ numbers written as    .xxxxx don't parse

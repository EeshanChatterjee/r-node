# Quick TODO list, until I get a issue tracker running for R-Node
#

Configuration of file upload has it's own 'R tmp'/'our tmp' directory
configuration. This needs to use the generic one.


The code in the R handler to download files to the client needs to be
moved into the main codebase to support generic file download, linked
to session.


The client UI should have an interface to save and load sessions, saved
to a per-username. Only available when users must log in.


It seems that R version 2.10 includes a new help mechanism, which breaks
R-Node's current approach to retrieving the HTML help.

Multiline commands in the console.

Functions to support:

1/  help()  under R 2.10
2/  ?? searching help
3/  sink() doesn't work 
4/  Support 'edit()' command
5/  Can't draw a histogram using server.
6/  scan() doesn't work
7/  example() doesn't work
8/  demo() isn't supported.
9/  locator() is not suported.
10/ identify() is not supported.
11/ library() command is not supported.

12/ a command such as file.show(filepath) will not get picked up for the pager.


package management could be better (e.g. library(), search(), loadedNamespaces())

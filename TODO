# Quick TODO list, until I get a issue tracker running for R-Node

Configuration of file upload has it's own 'R tmp'/'our tmp' directory
configuration. This needs to use the generic one.


The code in the R handler to download files to the client needs to be
moved into the main codebase to support generic file download, linked
to session.


The client UI should have an interface to save and load sessions, saved
to a per-username. Only available when users must log in.


Multiline commands in the console.

Functions to support:

1/  Not all v2.10 help works (as some URL's after searching are not correctly relative)
        To fix - use a different port for help for 2.10 and just proxy
        all requests to help server.

2/  ?? searching help (will in 2.10 when 1 is fixed)
3/  sink() doesn't work 
4/  Support 'edit()' command
5/  Can't draw a histogram using server.
6/  scan() doesn't work
7/  example() doesn't work
8/  demo() isn't supported.
9/  locator() is not suported.
10/ identify() is not supported.
11/ library() command is not supported.

package management could be better (e.g. library(), search(), loadedNamespaces())
